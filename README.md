DIY Robotic Hoover, made from CNC plywood, Arduino and Stepper motors.

Developing project based on Arduino as the Controller, cnc cut plywood parts, Nemo 14 Stepper motors and some 3d printed parts

Using an old PC CPU fan for the suction fan, best option here is to use as high an air flow fan as possible.
